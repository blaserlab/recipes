## Ingredients

| **Amount** 	| **Item** 		|
|---------------|-----------------------|
| 400 mg 	| tricaine powder	|	
| 97.9 ml 	| Millipore water 	|
| ~2.1 ml 	| 1 M Tris (pH 9) 	|


## Directions

1.  Mix the above ingredients
2.  Adjust pH to ~7. 
3.  Store this solution at 4C in the dark. (Buy the smallest amount possible because tricaine gets old.)

## Notes

To use tricaine as an anesthetic for adults combine the following in a 250 ml beaker:

- 4.2 ml tricaine solution
- ~100 ml clean tank water.

Put the fish in this and it will be asleep in a few seconds.

To use tricaine as an anesthetic for embryos up to 72 hpf use approximately 1 squirt from a disposable fisherbrand pipette per plate, or 40 uL per 1 mL of agarose gel for mounting.  Larvae are more sensitive to tricaine after 72 hpf so use less after this stage.

Tricaine (3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester also called ethyl 3-aminobenzoate) comes in a powdered form from Sigma (Cat.# A-5040). It is also available as Finquel (Part No. C-FINQ-UE) from Argent Chemical Laboratories, Inc. Make tricaine solution for anesthetizing fish by combining the following in a glass bottle with a screw cap:

Tricaine strength varies by manufacturer so modify accordingly.
