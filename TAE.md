# TAE- 50X
 
## Ingredients	
Below are the ingredients and the amounts required for this lab solution.

| **Amount**   	| **Item** 		|
|---------------|-----------------------|
| 1 L   	| Millipore water	|  
| 242 g		| Tris base 		|
| 57.1 mL 	| Acetic acid 		|
| 100 mL	| 0.5M EDTA (pH 8.0) 	|


### Components
Recipe for 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)
| **Amount**   	| **Item** 			|
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| 186.1 g	| Disodium EDTA dihydrate 	|
| 800 mL	| Millipore water 		|
| ~20  g	| NaOH pellets			|
	
 
## Directions	

1.  Combine water, Tris base, acetic acid, and 0.5M EDTA.  
2.  Stir until dissolved. 
3.  For the EDTA, mix EDTA in water. 
4.  Adjust pH to 8.0 using NaOH. EDTA will not dissolve until pH is reached. 
5.  Aliquot and autoclave on liquid cycle. 
6.  Make a 1X working stock by diluting 1:50 in Millipore Water
