Directions	

Step	Action
1	Add 100 mL of H2O to a clean glass bottle. 
2	Add the above reagents to the bottle. 
3	Carefully measure the deoxycholic acid in the hood. Add the powder to the bottle in the hood. 
4	Add the remaining water to fill the bottle to 200 mL.
5	Mix well. 
6	Store at 4°C.
	
7	Immediately before use, add proteases and phosphatases. 
	
 
Yields	200 mL of lysis buffer
